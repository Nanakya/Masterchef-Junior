Weeknight Lemon Chicken Skillet Dinner

Description:-
This one-pan chicken dinner doesn't get much easier, or more satisfying. In just half an hour, you can have a complete meal on the table that doesn't require loads of dishes afterwards. We call for tender haricots verts because they're quick cooking; traditional green beans likely won't be tender enough after the brief cooking time at the end. If that's all you have on hand, steam them first, and then add them to the pan for the final step. Serve this hearty chicken and potatoes dinner with a simple side salad to sneak in another serving of veggies.

Ingridients:-
1. 12 ounces baby red potatoes, halved
2. 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
3. 4 (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to 3/4-inch thickness
4. 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
5. 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
6. 2 thyme sprigs
7. 4 ounces cremini mushrooms, quartered
8. 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
9. 1/4 cup whole milk
10. 5 teaspoons all-purpose flour
11. 1 3/4 cups unsalted chicken stock (such as Swanson)
12. 8 very thin lemon slices
13. 1 (8-ounce) package trimmed haricots verts (French green beans)
14. 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

How to make it:-

Step 1. Preheat oven to 450*.
Step 2. Place potatoes in a medium saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, and simmer 12 minutes or until tender. Drain.
Step 3. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil to pan. Sprinkle chicken with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add chicken and thyme     sprigs to pan; cook 5 minutes or until chicken is browned. Turn chicken over. Place pan in oven; bake at 450Â° for 10 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove chicken from pan.

Step 4. Return pan to medium-high heat. Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Add potatoes, cut sides down; mushrooms; and 1 tablespoon thyme; cook 3 minutes or until browned, stirring once. Combine milk and flour in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add remaining salt, remaining pepper, flour mixture, stock, lemon, and beans to pan; simmer 1 minute or until slightly thickened. Add chicken; cover, reduce heat, and simmer 3 minutes or until beans are crisp-tender. Sprinkle with parsley.
